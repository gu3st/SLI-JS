The ```show-devices.js```\nprogram can be used to display all HID devices in the system.\n\n## How to Use\n\n### Load the extension\n\n```\nvar HID = require('HID');\n```\n\n### Get a list of all HID devices in the system:\n\n```\nvar devices = HID.devices()\n```\n\ndevices will contain an array of objects, one for each HID device\navailable.  Of particular interest are the ```vendorId``` and\n```productId```, as they uniquely identify a device, and the\n```path```, which is needed to open a particular device.\n\nHere is some sample output:\n```\nHID.devices();\n[ { vendorId: 1452,\n    productId: 595,\n    path: 'USB_05ac_0253_0x100a148e0',\n    serialNumber: '',\n    manufacturer: 'Apple Inc.',\n    product: 'Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad',\n    release: 280,\n    interface: -1 },\n  { vendorId: 1452,\n    productId: 595,\n    path: 'USB_05ac_0253_0x100a14e20',\n    serialNumber: '',\n    manufacturer: 'Apple Inc.',\n    product: 'Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad',\n    release: 280,\n    interface: -1 },\n<and more>\n```\n\n### Opening a device\n\nBefore a device can be read from or written to, it must be opened:\n\n```\nvar device = new HID.HID(path);\n```\n\n```device``` will contain a handle to the device.  The ```path``` can\nbe determined by a prior HID.devices() call.  If an error occurs\nopening the device, an exception will be thrown.\n\n### Reading from a device\n\nReading from a device is performed using the read call on a device\nhandle:\n\n```\ndevice.read(function(error, data) {});\n```\n\nAll reading is asynchronous.\n\n### Writing to a device\n\nWriting to a device is performed using the write call in a device\nhandle.  All writing is synchronous.\n\n```\ndevice.write([0x00, 0x01, 0x01, 0x05, 0xff, 0xff]);\n```\n\n### Support\n\nIf you need help, send me an email (hans.huebner@gmail.com)\n",
